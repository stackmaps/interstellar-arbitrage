# interstellar-arbitrage

Intermediate-level Python 3 learning project focused on how to use an API.


## Difficulty Level:  INTERMEDIATE

To progress through the following challenges, you should have a basic understanding of downloading and using Python packages from pypi and be able to look through the raw output to identify important information.

## The Story

One day, a space pirate from Pluto realized that he could plunder from the comfort of his computer in a totally legal way. The pirate used APIs to inform him of the prices people were willing to buy and sell space currencies for on different planets. With this information, he coded his space-dog to tell him when one planet wanted a space currency for more than another planet was willing to sell it for. He then bought that currency from the cheaper seller and upsold it to the more expensive buyer, making a profit. The space pirate abandons his old ways turning instead to automated sales and making much more Jupiter-gold in the process.

## What you will learn

In this project, you will learn about:
* the `urllib2` module
* what an API is
* JSON parsing
